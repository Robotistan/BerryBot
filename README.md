# BerryBot Programmable Educational Robot
BerryBot is a robotic programming kit that aims to develop children's skills in robotics infrastructure, basic programming, hand-arm coordination, problem-solving, and more. Thanks to the motherboard on the kit, the motor connections that enable the robot to move physically can be made quickly. The robot's mechanical and electronic setup can be completed in a short time due to its easily assembled wooden body.

After completing the setup, you can improve your programming skills by programming BerryBot using the PicoBricks IDE, either block-based or text-based.

With the tracks included in the kit, you can quickly create common projects such as line following, sumo, light tracking, and obstacle-avoiding robots using the mobile application. Alternatively, you can learn how the algorithms for these projects are developed and write the code using the PicoBricks IDE. Additionally, you can organize fun activities with your friends by completing the tasks in the booklet or creating your own tasks based on your imagination, using the other track included in the kit.
